This is my Project "0x1C. C - Makefiles" at ALX Software Engineering.


At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain, without the help of Google:


1. What are make, Makefiles?
2. When, why and how to use Makefiles?
3. What are rules and how to set and use them?
4. What are explicit and implicit rules?
5. What are the most common / useful rules?
6. What are variables and how to set and use them?
